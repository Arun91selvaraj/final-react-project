lifecycle events and hooks:
class component=> 
	componentDidMount():void{}
	componentDidUpdate(prevProps:Readonly<?>, prevState:ReadOnly<?>, snapshot?:object){}
	componentWillUnmount():void{}

React Hooks: APIs (functions)
	useState()
	useEffect()
	useReducer()
	useRef()
	useContext()
	.....

type SamplePropType={
	postId:number
}
function Sample(props:ReadOnly<SamplePropType>){

	const [post, setPost]= useState<Post|null>(null)
	const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage]= useState<string>('')
	
	useEffect(
		()=>{
			fetchPost(props.postId)
			.then(
				(resp)=>setPost(res.data),
				(err)=>setErrorMessage(err.message))

			return ()=>{ //clean-up code}
		},
		[props.postId]
	)

	return <div></div>
}


<Sample postId={1}/>

1. no dependency array as the 2nd argument to useEffect
useEffect(
	()=>{
		//code
		return ()=>{ }
	}
)
Effect: the callback will be called every time you the component function is called (like componentDidUpdate() every time)
the clean-up callback will be called also every time, but in the next round

2. dependency array with dependency factors as the 2nd argument to useEffect
useEffect(
	()=>{
		//code
		return ()=>{}
	},[value1, value2,....]
)
useEffect(
	()=>{
		//code
		return ()=>{}
	}, [value3]
)
Effect: the callback will be called only when one of the dependency factors change (like componentDidUpdate() conditionally)
the clean-up callback will be called conditionally, but in the next round

3. blank dependency array as the 2nd argument to useEffect
useEffect(
	()=>{
		//code
		return ()=>{}
	}, []
)
Effect: the callback will be called ONLY one time, and that is the very first time (like componentDidMount()) it is mounted
the clean-up callback will be called ONLY one time,when the component is unmounted


state management via Redux:
creating a central repository of all the states of an application
synchronous and predictable manner of state mamagement

terminologies:
store: an object to save states
reducer:a function dedicated to state (part of the store)
reducer map: an object containing references to every reducer in the store
state: the state
action: an object. everyone, who subscribes to a state of the store, must send an action object to update state. it should contain at least one property, named, 'type'
dispatch: a function provided by the store so that anyone can send an action object to update the state

install:
>npm i redux

with react:
>npm i redux
>npm i react-redux => connects the react application with redux

importable members of redux:
applyMiddleware() => apply different middlewares on redux store
ex: redux-logger
createStore() => create store object
